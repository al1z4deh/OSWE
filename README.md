Month 1:

Week 1: Start by building your foundational knowledge of web application security testing. You can use the Web Application Security Testing Fundamentals course from PortSwigger Academy and the Web Application Hacker's Handbook to learn about web application security principles, techniques, and tools.

Week 2: Focus on learning about the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited. Use the OWASP Top 10 document and the OWASP Juice Shop to practice finding and exploiting these vulnerabilities.

Week 3: Begin practicing your coding skills using Python. You can use the Python for Penetration Testing course from Udemy and practice coding exercises on sites like HackerRank.

Week 4: Practice reconnaissance techniques using tools like Nmap, Recon-ng, and theHarvester.

Month 2:

Week 1: Continue practicing your coding skills with Python and begin learning about web application exploitation techniques using tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and Fiddler.

Week 2: Start practicing exploiting vulnerabilities using deliberately vulnerable applications like DVWA, Mutillidae, and OWASP Juice Shop.

Week 3: Begin exploring web application security testing challenges on HackTheBox and try to solve as many challenges as possible.

Week 4: Learn about Metasploit Framework and how it can be used for penetration testing by completing the Metasploit Unleashed course.

Month 3:

Week 1: Practice exploiting web application vulnerabilities using a combination of manual techniques and tools like Metasploit, sqlmap, and XSStrike.

Week 2: Start practicing using the OSWE virtual lab environment to get familiar with the exam format.

Week 3: Join online communities like Reddit's netsec and OWASP to connect with other security enthusiasts and learn from their experiences.

Week 4: Review and consolidate your knowledge by completing practice exams and mock exams that simulate the OSWE exam format.
